# Fantasy Football Dashboard

## Project Overview
This is a personal project I took on for the benefit of myself as well as the rest of my fantasy football league members. The goal is to create an up-to-date dashboard that helps owners better understand and manage their fantasy teams.   

In this project, a database is created in MySQL using data pulled from Sleeper and ESPN API's. The database is connected to Tableau that has a custom dashboard built to better understand and display the data.
